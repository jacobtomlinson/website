The PyData software ecosystem is made up of many open-source software libraries that are used heavily in Python Software Development, Data Science/Engineering, Traditional Sciences, Artificial Intelligence and beyond. They were used to fly a helicopter on Mars, drive new discoveries around climate change and generate the first image of a black hole.

But what makes a software library part of the PyData ecosystem? Who funds the development of these libraries? Can anyone get involved?

This talk will dig into the history of the PyData ecosystem, how open-source projects are created and maintained and who builds the PyData software stack today.
