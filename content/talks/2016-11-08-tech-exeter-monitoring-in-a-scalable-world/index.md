In the Met Office Informatics Lab we are currently building a scalable big-data platform and in order to performance test and monitor this we have implemented a mix of ELK. TICK and Grafana to gather useful data. With the infrastructure being scalable the monitoring platform has to scale along with it. All of the information derived must also react to an ever changing number of source systems.
