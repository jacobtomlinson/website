If you read reports from organizations like the CNCF they will tell you that 90% of people are developing in containers, 69% are running them in production and 77% of those are using Kubernetes to manage them. However those surveys are biased towards a self-selecting group of container converts.

This session will cover container technology from the ground up. You will learn how to package and run applications using Docker, orchestrate those containers on clusters in the cloud using Kubernetes and perform reliable and reproducible deployments with Helm.

It will be aimed at those with all levels of container knowledge so whether you're at the early stages of thinking about using containers, or running them in production don't feel left behind with this fast paced technology.
