I was invited to join the [Kubernetes Batch Working Group (k8s-batch-sig)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-batch/README.md) to give an overview of how [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) runs on Kubernetes, especially for batch style workloads with [`DaskJob`](https://kubernetes.dask.org/en/latest/operator_resources.html#daskjob).
