In October 2015 I gave a talk on Kubernetes at Tech Exeter (back when it was called the Exeter Web Meetup).

Kris Sum thought it would be fun for the Tech Exeter May 2025 Meetup for a few of us who gave a talk in 2015 to give an update on those talks.

My talk has two parallel threads. One is a meta thread about giving talks, career growth in public speaking, getting better at persuasion, planting flags to evidence expertise. The second is on Kubernetes and why the core concepts are powerful and have made it what it is. It’s valuable to understand the core concepts even if you don’t use Kubernetes.
