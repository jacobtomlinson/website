Straight from our own Informatics Lab, Jacob will share how to perform large scale distributed data analysis on any cloud platform with Pangeo. Pangeo is a suite of open source tools created and curated by the geoscience community to make big scale scientific analysis possible on any cloud platform. It uses Kubernetes to bring consistency to the workflow and it brings popular scientific python libraries together to work interoperability.
