At the Dask Summit I chaired a workshop called [Deploying Dask](https://summit.dask.org/schedule/presentation/20/deploying-dask/). This workshop was comprised of multiple talks delivered by myself and others.

This first talk covered an how a [Dask distributed](https://speakerdeck.com/jacobtomlinson/deploying-dask-distributed) cluster is deployed at a low level with manually running a scheduler and some workers and then connecting a client. We also walked through how these pieces find each other and communicate, and how we can find out more information ourselves using the dashboard and utilities in Python.
