At the Dask Summit I chaired a workshop called [Deploying Dask](https://summit.dask.org/schedule/presentation/20/deploying-dask/). This workshop was comprised of multiple talks delivered by myself and others.

This second talk gives an overview on all the ways Dask can be deployed on Kubernetes today.
