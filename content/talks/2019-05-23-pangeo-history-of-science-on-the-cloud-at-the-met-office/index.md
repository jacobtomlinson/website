The Informatics Lab is a technology, science and design research group at the Met Office. For the last four years we've been exploring, among other things, how we can do more science using the power of cloud computing. Using tools such as Jupyter, Dask and Kubernetes we've built a number of prototypes of cloud based scientific platforms starting with our JADE project through to current implementations of Pangeo. In this session we will cover how we evolved these systems, produced tools like dask-kubernetes and the Pangeo helm chart, helped build a community, and pushed our science and the Met Office forward.
