Recently I decided to use Amazon&#8217;s S3 as another location to store some of my server backups. However I found when testing that I was unable to upload my backup tarballs to S3. I ended up with the following errors.

```
jacob@server:backups$ s3cmd put backup-20140731.tar.gz s3://test-bucket/backup-20140731.tar.gz

```

The file I&#8217;m uploading isn&#8217;t huge (238MB). So it wasn&#8217;t the known limit of trying to <a title="Amazon S3 docs - 5GB put limit" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html" target="_blank">upload files which are greater than 5GB</a>.

```
jacob@server:backups$ ll
total 238M
-rw------- 1 jacob 238M Jul 31 06:00 backup-20140731.tar.gz
```

It seems that this is a common issue when uploading files to a new bucket. Something to do with the DNS propagation means it takes a little while before your bucket can successfully accept files. More info <a title="Google Code thread mentioning DNS issues" href="https://code.google.com/p/s3ql/issues/detail?id=363#c13" target="_blank">here</a>.

After waiting a few hours running the same command completes successfully.
