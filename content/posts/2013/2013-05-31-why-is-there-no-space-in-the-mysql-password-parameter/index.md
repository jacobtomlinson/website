title: Why is there no space in the MySQL password parameter?

After troubleshooting a MySQL issue with a colleague we began discussing a "feature"
of the MySQL command line which insists that you don't put a space in the password parameter
when using the short parameter. We both felt that it was rather inconsistent to allow the usage of
`-h hostname` or `-u username` but insist on `-ppassword` instead of `-p password`. You can of course
use the full parameter `--password=password` but as most people use the shorthand commands it
just seems slightly unintuitive.

After doing a bit of reading it appears that this is due to the value
being optional. If you don't specify a password in the command it will prompt you for one,
therefore if you had the option to include a space it wouldn't be able to tell if you've
specified a password or the next parameter. This still seems a little kludgy to me but I guess there
is some reasoning behind it.

Here is the official reasoning from the MySQL website.

> For a long option that takes a value, separate the option name and the value by an `=` sign.
> For a short option that takes a value, the option value can immediately follow the option letter,
> or there can be a space between: `-hlocalhost` and `-h localhost` are equivalent. An exception to
> this rule is the option for specifying your MySQL password. This option can be given in long form as
> [-password=pass_val][1] or as [-password][1]. In the latter case (with no password
> value given), the program prompts you for the password. The password option also may be given in
> short form as `-ppass_val` or as `-p`. However, for the short form, if the password value is given,
> it must follow the option letter with *no intervening space*. The reason for this is that if a space
> follows the option letter, the program has no way to tell whether a following argument is supposed
> to be the password value or some other kind of argument.
