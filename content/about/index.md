From time to time I give [talks](/talks) and run workshops and folks will ask me for a bio. You may even be one of those folks and I've directed you to this page! Huzzah the system works!

Here's a bunch of different length bio's that anyone is welcome to use if you're organizing an event and you need a bio for me.

_Note: This page may be updated from time to time._
