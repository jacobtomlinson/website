### Introduction

I've decided to wipe my MacBook and reinstall everything! The current installation has been hanging around for the last few years and has even migrated between hardware with Time Machine. Things are starting to feel a little slow, I've installed lots of things in the past which I don't want any more, and I just want a fresh start. I've backed it up with Time Machine just in case and I'm ready to get started.

In a similar vein to the [year roundup posts][2015-roundup] that I've done I'm going to make a list of everything I will be installing on my MacBook after wiping it.
